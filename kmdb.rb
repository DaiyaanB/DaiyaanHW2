# In this assignment, you'll be using the domain model from hw1 (found in the hw1-solution.sql file)
# to create the database structure for "KMDB" (the Kellogg Movie Database).
# The end product will be a report that prints the movies and the top-billed
# cast for each movie in the database.

# To run this file, run the following command at your terminal prompt:
# `rails runner kmdb.rb`

# Requirements/assumptions
#
# - There will only be three movies in the database â€“ the three films
#   that make up Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.
# - Movie data includes the movie title, year released, MPAA rating,
#   and studio.
# - There are many studios, and each studio produces many movies, but
#   a movie belongs to a single studio.
# - An actor can be in multiple movies.
# - Everything you need to do in this assignment is marked with TODO!

# Rubric
# 
# There are three deliverables for this assignment, all delivered within
# this repository and submitted via GitHub and Canvas:
# - Generate the models and migration files to match the domain model from hw1.
#   Table and columns should match the domain model. Execute the migration
#   files to create the tables in the database. (5 points)
# - Insert the "Batman" sample data using ruby code. Do not use hard-coded ids.
#   Delete any existing data beforehand so that each run of this script does not
#   create duplicate data. (5 points)
# - Query the data and loop through the results to display output similar to the
#   sample "report" below. (10 points)

# Submission
# 
# - "Use this template" to create a brand-new "hw2" repository in your
#   personal GitHub account, e.g. https://github.com/<USERNAME>/hw2
# - Do the assignment, committing and syncing often
# - When done, commit and sync a final time before submitting the GitHub
#   URL for the finished "hw2" repository as the "Website URL" for the 
#   Homework 2 assignment in Canvas

# Successful sample output is as shown:

# Delete existing data, so you'll start fresh each time this script is run.
# Use `Model.destroy_all` code.

# Generate models and tables, according to the domain model.
#rails generate model Studio - Did this in terminal, then edited the newly-created db-migrate files as shown in files before running rails db:migrate
